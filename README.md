# LendInvest Coding Test


Hi and welcome to my code solution!

***

## Installation

In order to run this project you will require to have docker installed.


Once you have it cloned just run: 

```
docker-compose up -d
```


This will create the containers. Once the process is being complete you should have an image for the repository and one for nginx running.


Log into the solution image using: 
```
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```


Then just run: 
```
composer install
```


***After this last command the app is ready!***


You can run all the PhpUnit tests with:
```
composer test
```

### Some other notes (optional)

* If you get lost I did a Entity-Relationship Diagram just for you. Surprise is in diagrams folder.
* I left tons of comments on purpose. I understand how boring could be read code tests.
* This app has been develop in an Ubuntu 20.04 local environment. I love Linux.
* I used as a IDE Sublime Text 3. Sorry in advance of the namespaces are not alphabetically ordered. 
* The user name of my machine is neo and the machine name matrix, just in case you find any reference.
